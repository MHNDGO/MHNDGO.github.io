                What is dubizzle:
                <br>
dubizzle is the leading classifieds platform for users in the United Arab Emirates. Since its launch in 2005, dubizzle has become the number one platform for users to buy, sell, or find anything in their community.
<br>

A community where underused goods are redistributed to fill a new need, and become wanted again, where non-product assets such as space, skills, and money are exchanged and traded in new ways that don’t always require centralized institutions or ‘middlemen’. dubizzle is a part of the Dubizzle Group Holdings Limited which also operates the largest property classified sites in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Morocco.
<br>

In April 2020, the Dubizzle Group Holdings Limited merged with the Netherlands-based OLX Group in certain key markets, and was valued at $1 Billion, giving it the coveted unicorn status. The group now also owns and operates Bayut in the UAE, OLX Pakistan, OLX Egypt and OLX Lebanon, in addition to several other platforms in the broader Middle East region, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar.
<br>

Now situated in the heart of Dubai Design District, Dubai’s skyline may have changed, but dubizzle has not, and there is so much more to come.
<br>

If you need anything to buy or sell, all you need is dubizzle! Yalla, let’s go.
