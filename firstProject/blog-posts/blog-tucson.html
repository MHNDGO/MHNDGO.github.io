        <h1 class="blog-title">Car History: Hyundai Tucson</h1>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Hyundai is one of the most popular automobile brands across the globe.
          The brand is credited for rolling off vehicles equipped with
          technologically advanced features. Along with this, the price and
          feature equilibrium is also important factor that contributes to its
          popularity. Although the brand has been manufacturing vehicles since
          the 1960s, it started manufacturing SUVs in the 2000s. Despite being
          relatively new in the category, Hyundai’s SUV performed significantly
          well, especially the Tucson. The first Tucson model was released
          almost two decades ago and since then it is performing exceptionally
          in the SUV category.
          <br />
          Let’s take a closer look at the Hyundai Tucson history, its different
          models and generations.

        <p class="blog-content">
          <br />
          The exceptional performance of the Hyundai Tucson is testified by the
          used non-luxury annual car market report 2021 in which Hyundai is
          ranked among the top used SUVs.
          <br />
          Here is the complete Tucson history that will further elaborate on
          this iconic SUV series:

        <p class="blog-content">
          The first model of the Hyundai Tucson was released in 2005. The car
          was manufactured on the heavily modified Elantra platform. First
          generation Tucson was available in three different trim levels: GL,
          GLS and GLX.
          <br />
          This mid-size SUV has a shorter height and a wider wheelbase that
          caters to its rugged-off exterior. The radiator grille was sandwiched
          between two eye-shaped headlights. Contours were present on the body
          that runs from the front to the rear end.
          <br />
          For the interior, Hyundai opted for a simple dashboard design that
          features easy-to-read gauges and metres. The comfortable seats were
          available with optional leather or fabric covers. For maximum
          protection, side airbags were also installed in the cabin.
          <br />
          This generation of Hyundai Tucson was powered by a 2.0-litre
          4-cylinder engine paired with a 4WD drivetrain system and a 4-speed
          automatic transmission system. To make it suitable for off-roading, a
          low-range transfer case, stability control, traction control and
          antilock brakes were also present.

          The second generation Tucson was released at the Frankfurt Motor Show
          in 2009. This generation was completely different from the old Tucson
          model. The second generation receives a major facelift with redesigned
          exterior and interior.
          <br />
          The old eye-shaped headlights were replaced with more elongated and
          pointed headlights. Whereas, the previous contours were replaced with
          sharp angles and lines running from front to rear end. At the rear
          end, a hatchback-styled tailgate was present to accompany this new
          appearance of Tucson. Along with this, alloy wheels were offered in
          all the trim levels of this generation.
          <br />
          The interior was also redesigned with an updated dashboard, centre
          console, stack and comfortable seats. Moreover, the rear flat floor
          also aids in increasing the comfort level.
          <br />
          Under the hood, 2.0 and 2.4-litre engines were available with an AWD
          drivetrain system. This drivetrain system was supported by a 5-speed
          manual or 6-speed automatic transmission system.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          The facelifted version of the second-generation Tucson was introduced
          in 2013. The front fascia was redesigned with large bumpers and
          foglights. Along with this, projector lamps and LED daytime running
          headlights and taillights were installed. Moreover, an optional
          panoramic glass roof with roof rails was also available.
          <br />
          The length of the wheelbase was increased making the cabin more
          spacious. In this spacious cabin reclining back, seats and cup holders
          were present. For the drivers, a pale-blue backlit instrument cluster
          was installed that provided necessary details regarding the vehicle.
          Furthermore, to keep the cabin pleasant, Tucson features a
          germ-killing ioniser and climate control system.
          <br />
          However, no significant changes were observed under the hood. A 2.0
          and 2.4-litre 4-cylinder engine and 6-speed automatic transmission
          system were constant. However, an optional 2WD or AWD drivetrain
          system was also available.

          The third-generation Hyundai Tucson was unveiled at the 2015 New York
          International Auto Show. This generation was completely different from
          Hyundai Tucson’s old models. The front fascia features a signature
          Hyundai hexagonal radiator grille, LED twin projectors and LED daytime
          running headlights. The wheelbase was widened which increases the
          overall comfort and ride experience. For the first time, optional
          19-inch alloys were also offered to the customers.
          <br />
          The interior was refined to provide a premium experience to the
          travellers. A touch-screen infotainment system and leather-wrapped
          instrument panel as standard. Along with this, the car also features a
          Blue Link system that enhances the overall safety of the vehicle. The
          Blue Link was supported by an Android system through which drivers can
          lock/unlock doors, and find and trace the location of their car.
          <br />
          The car was powered by a 2.0-litre engine accompanied by a 6-speed
          automatic transmission system and an AWD drivetrain. To increase its
          off-roading capabilities, Hyundai installed a hillstart assist,
          downhill brake control system in the third generation of Tucson.

          In the facelifted version of Tucson’s third generation, the headlights
          were redesigned and uplifted daytime running lights were introduced.
          Whereas, the brake lights were more narrowed and submerged with the
          tailgate. At the front, large air-intakes were also present to
          complete the sharp exterior of the car plus a redesigned grille that
          makes it look fancy.
          <br />
          The interior was also redesigned with an upgraded dashboard and newly
          designed air vents. Along with this, the side mirror, instrument
          cluster and centre stack were also upgraded.
          <br />
          The engine lineup remains the same as in the third generation.
          However, collision avoidance system and lane-keeping assist systems
          were embedded for enhanced safety.

          The latest generation of the Tucson is an SUV-Coupe style and does not
          resemble its predecessors. At the front, a large radiator grille, 3D
          design headlights and redesigned bumpers are present. Whereas, flared
          fenders are present at both ends.
          <br />
          The interior features a flat minimalistic dashboard with two dial
          instrument cluster and a large infotainment system present at the
          centre.
          <br />
          Three engines are available in this generation, a 2.0-litre, 1.6T-GDi
          smart stream petrol engine and 1.6 T HEV hybrid engine. Both engines
          are supported by drive and terrain modes. Whereas, for better safety,
          Hyundai smart sense is installed.
          <br /><br />
          This was the complete Hyundai Tucson history. Since its inception,
          Tucson has secured a significant position in the SUV category because
          of the features and comfort it provides.
